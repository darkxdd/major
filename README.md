## üìä Model Performance
Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that transformer-based models significantly outperform traditional machine learning approaches for disease prediction:

| Model | Accuracy (%) | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Passive Aggressive | 81.2 | 0.805 | 0.798 | 0.801 |
| Naive Bayes | 84.7 | 0.838 | 0.832 | 0.835 |
| BiLSTM | 87.9 | 0.871 | 0.865 | 0.868 |
| BERT | 91.6 | 0.908 | 0.899 | 0.903 |
| ModernBERT | 93.3 | 0.925 | 0.918 | 0.921 |
| RoBERTa | **95.1** | **0.943** | **0.937** | **0.940** |

## ü§ñ Transformer Models in Healthcare
MediSense leverages the power of transformer-based architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance in disease prediction:

### BERT and Its Variants
[BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) revolutionized NLP by introducing bidirectional training to language models. In MediSense, we utilize BERT to understand complex symptom descriptions and medical terminology. Our implementation of ModernBERT includes healthcare-specific fine-tuning to better capture medical context.

### RoBERTa
Our highest-performing model uses [RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692), which improves upon BERT with:
- Dynamic masking patterns
- Larger batch sizes
- Longer training sequences
- Improved training methodology

RoBERTa achieves 95.1% accuracy in disease prediction by better capturing the subtle relationships between symptoms and conditions.

### Future Directions
We're exploring integration of GPT-based models for:
- More natural patient-system interactions
- Generation of detailed explanations for predictions
- Analysis of unstructured medical notes and reports

## üíª Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **ML/DL Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Natural Language Processing**: spaCy, NLTK
- **Visualization**: D3.js, Matplotlib
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages
